# Naive Bayes Classifier

This project showcases the implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification problems, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as spam detection and sentiment analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization
- Implementation using scikit-learn’s MultinomialNB
- Applied on datasets like SMS Spam Collection
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Structure

- `naive_bayes_spam.ipynb`: Spam detection using Naive Bayes
- `naive_bayes_sentiment.ipynb`: Sentiment classification project
- `data/`: Contains sample datasets used

## 📊 Results

- Achieved >95% accuracy on spam classification
- Clear insights from confusion matrix and precision-recall scores
